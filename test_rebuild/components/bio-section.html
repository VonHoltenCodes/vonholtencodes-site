        Welcome to <strong>VonHoltenCodes.com</strong>, a free, ultra-retro playground designed for kids by me! 
        Built to spark curiosity, it's packed with <span class="bio-highlight">NASA</span> and <span class="bio-highlight">USGS</span> APIs, 
        weather updates, time trackers, jokes, and fun games. Explore safe, kid-friendly links and take charge in 
        <strong>Mission Control</strong>â€”a private, no-email-needed, one-way messaging system where you can share ideas, 
        suggest features, or tweak code. With an industrial machine vibe, this site is open to everyone, 
        always free, and all about inspiring young minds to create and explore!
